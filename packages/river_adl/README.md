# River ADL

The River ADL is a library which provides a method of generating assembly through Dart in an HDL-like design.

## Why an ADL instead of an Assembly Language?

An ADL makes more sense for River due to the design of the source.
River can be generated purely through a single command.
Having a method to assemble binaries in Dart streamlines the build process.
